# REST API Template
A template for a REST API written in Typescript. It subscribes to a layered pattern based on Martin Fowler's layering patterns in Enterprise Application Architecture. Controllers handle routing and data preparation, and subsequently request preparation and sending. Services encapsulate business logic likely operating on some database object through some data access layer.
